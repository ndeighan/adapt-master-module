adapt-narrativeWithAudio
===================

An Adapt core contributed narrative component that displays images with corresponding text and left and right navigation controls to progress through the narrative.

The narrative control renders differently when Adapt.device.screenSize is 'small'.  In this cas the corresponding text is only available by clicking the '+' icon.

Installation
------------

First, be sure to install the [Adapt Command Line Interface](https://github.com/cajones/adapt-cli), then from the command line run:-

		adapt install adapt-narrativeWithAudio

Usage
-----
Once installed, the component can be used to create a narrative control comprised of one or more graphic components and associated text and a means of navigating between them.
